# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Analysis Overview

The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations using following methods:  preprocessing the data for the neural network model, compile, train and evaluate the model, optimize the model.

## Results

The model accuracy is under 75%. This is not a satisfying performance to help predict the outcome of the charity donations.

## Summary

The deep learning neural network model did not reach the target of 75% accuracy. Considering that this target level is pretty average we could say that the model is not outperforming.
Since we are in a binary classification situation, we could use a supervised machine learning model such as the Random Forest Classifier to combine a multitude of decision trees to generate a classified output and evaluate its performance against our deep learning model.
